# CONFIGURATION GUIDE:
# The symbol '&' is used for color codes
# For SPIGOT ONLY in 1.16+: RGB support in one of the following formats: $(RED,GREEN,BLUE)$ OR &#RRGGBB
# RED, GREEN and BLUE range from 0 to 255
# RR, GG and BB follow the hex color codes, from 00 to ff
# Any message can be disabled by setting the text to "ignored" or "", an example can be found below
# some_setting: "ignored"
# another_setting: ""

# How to use square brackets? [ and ]
# BetterSleeping uses those to distinguish singular and plural words so you cannot directly use [ and ].
# However, you can use |( and )| instead, they will be replaced by [ and ] respectively
# |( This )| will become [ This ].

# SINGULAR / PLURAL
# BetterSleeping supports singular and plural nouns
# This requires 3 contents: a (supported!) placeholder that will be replaced by a number, the singular form and the plural form
# Example: [<num_sleeping>.player.players] --> <num_sleeping> will be replaced by the corresponding amount. This placeholder must be supported by the provided message.
#   In this specific case:
#     When <num_sleeping> is equal to 1: everything between the [] will be replaced by player
#     When <num_sleeping> is NOT equal to 1: everything between the [] will be replaced by players
# Note: For this, you can use any placeholder that is replaced by a number (see below)


# PLACEHOLDERS
# <user>
#     Replaced by:      The player who receives the message
#     Can be used in:   All messages support this
#     Example:          When user Freddy_Krueger receives any message, <user> is replaced by Freddy_Krueger
#
# <player>
#     Replaced by:      The player who did an action
#     Can be used in:   bed_enter_broadcast, enough_sleeping, skipping_canceled
#     Example:          When user Freddy_Krueger goes to bed, <player> is replaced by Freddy_Krueger
#
# <num_sleeping>
#     Replaced by:      The amount of sleeping players
#     Can be used in:   bed_enter_message, bed_enter_broadcast, enough_sleeping, skipping_canceled
#     Example:          When 10 people are online and 4 are sleeping, <num_sleeping> is replaced by 4
#
# <needed_sleeping>
#     Replaced by:      The amount of sleeping players that have to sleep in order to skip the night
#     Can be used in:   bed_enter_message, bed_enter_broadcast, enough_sleeping, skipping_canceled, sleep_possible_soon, sleep_possible_now
#     Example:          When 4 players need to sleep, <needed_sleeping> is replaced by 4
#
# <remaining_sleeping>
#     Replaced by:      The amount of extra sleeping players that are needed
#     Can be used in:   bed_enter_message, bed_enter_broadcast, enough_sleeping, skipping_canceled
#     Example:          When 4 players are sleeping but 6 are needed, <remaining_sleeping> is replaced by 2
#
# <time>
#     Replaced by:      The amount of time in a context
#     Can be used in:   sleep_spam
#     Example:          When a player has just left their bed and has to wait 4 seconds before they can enter it again, <time> is replaced by 4
#
# <var>
#     Replaced by:      No_permission: the used command, buff_received: the amount of received buffs, debuff_received: the amount of received debuffs
#     Can be used in:   no_permission, buff_received, debuff_received
#     Example:          User executes /bs reload but has no access. <var> will be replaced by '/bs reload'
