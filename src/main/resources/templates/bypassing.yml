# To reset a BetterSleeping config file, you can simply delete it and perform /bs reload or restart the server

# Configuration guide and default values:       https://github.com/Nuytemans-Dieter/BetterSleeping/blob/v3.0.0/src/main/resources/bypassing.yml
# All default config files can be found here:   https://github.com/Nuytemans-Dieter/BetterSleeping/blob/v3.0.0/src/main/resources

# Players with bypass permissions WILL be counted towards the sleeping count
# They can get buffs if they sleep but not sleeping won't give them debuffs
# How to give bypass permissions? (meeting one of the requirements below is enough)
#     - Give permission bettersleeping.bypass
#     - Give permission essentials.sleepingingored (will only work if Essentials is installed on your server)
#     - Ignore a game mode in the list below and be in that gamemode

# Here you can choose whether or not you want BetterSleeping to ignore players with each gamemode
ignore_survival: {ignore_survival}
ignore_creative: {ignore_creative}
ignore_adventure: {ignore_adventure}
